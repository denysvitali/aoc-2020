# aoc-2020

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Languages

- Rust
- Python

### Why Python?

Because sometimes I don't have my computer with me, and I therefore want to quickly solve AoC on my phone
(I use Pydroid 3). Unfortunately to this date I still haven't found an alternative to my PC that's good enough
to let me have a good development experience - hence I stick with Pydroid 3 :(
